# Capacitated-Team-Orienteering-Problem

C++ code to build and run evaluation of the Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem

The algorithms were implemented and evaluated in order to write the paper which title is
"Improved Algorithms for Capacitated Budgeted Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing". 

There are two projects called Small_Capacity_Prize and Large_Capacity_Prize.

Small_Capacity_Prize is to run the algorithms in "Improved Algorithms for Capacitated Budgeted Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing" on instances given by 
Archetti et al. “The capacitated team orienteering and profitable tour problems”. Or on the instances generated by us. Both instances are available in the instance folder of Small_Capacity_Prize.

Large_Capacity_Prize is to run the algorithms in "Improved Algorithms for Capacitated Budgeted Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing" on instances given by 
Tarantilis et al. “The capacitated team orienteering problem: A bi-level filter-and-fan method”. The instances are available in instance folder of Large_Capacity_Prize.

There is a guide in each project of Small_Capacity_Prize and Large_Capacity_Prize to run the algorithms.
